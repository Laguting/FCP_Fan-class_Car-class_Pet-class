> 💻 The  program contains three(3) different classes that apply the lessons about Abstraction and Encapsulation.

# DESCRIPTION  📝
  ### "Fan Class"
  - The Fan class folder has Three (3) folders for the **Designs**, **Main file**, and **Fan class**.
  - It is set up where users can modify its **speed**, **power**, **fan's radius**, and **fan's color**.
  - Has a loading feature for initiation
  - installs **pyfiglet**, **termcolor**, and **tqdm**.
  ### "Car Class"
  - The Car class folder has Three (3) folders for the **Designs**, **Main file**, and **Car class**.
  - The car's **year model** and **made by** can be manipulated. However, its **speed** is set to be added *(Acceleration of the car)* and subtracted *(Brake of the car)* by five (5) after it is called.
  - It displays the Car's **Acceleration** and **Brake** five (5) times and performs the operation that if it accelerates the speed increases by five (5). If it brakes the speed decreases by five (5).
  - Has a loading feature for initiation
  - installs **pyfiglet**, **termcolor**, and **tqdm**.
  ### "Pet Class"
